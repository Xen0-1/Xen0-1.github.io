          <p><i>Apollyon</i> is the first game I worked on.
             This game is about exploring a cave where you find horrors beyond anything
             humanity has ever seen before. For this project, I did the sound design and
             level design. I am really proud of my work. </p>

            <p><i>Bready Or Knot</i> is the second big game project I worked on.
            I made it with the same team as <i>Apollyon</i>. I did all the 
            audio for the game. I had a great time and I believe it had some of
            my best work in it.</p>

            <p><i>Harpoon Bird Fishing</i> is a game about shooting birds out of the air with harpoons as a sport.
            I did all the music as well as some playtesting. I had a great time working with my team and they gave me amazing directions for my music work.
            It is very different compared to my normal work and I believe I did a great job despite that</p>
