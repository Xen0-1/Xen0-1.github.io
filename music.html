        <p>For the music of Bready or Knot I had to learn in very hard into synths to match the vibe of the game. It was my first time having a set theme for my music making</p>

    <hr>
        <p>For the music of Harpoon Bird Fishing, I could not use many synths in the sound tracks. That was a challenge because I am used to using synths as my main tool for music.
            I also had to do heaver music that I was also new at. Over all I am glad I worked on the game to get better with different kinds of music.</p>
